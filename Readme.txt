Instructions/helper(this will be improved in time):

1. You choose the folder or file to make the torrent.
2. It creates a file config.ini, with the folder/file paths and firefox session for later use.
you can change the data directly in the file.
3. Choose the .torrent path.
4: It searches for audio files and image.
5. It gets audio file for the metadata and image to upload,
if config file not there it asks for session(this can be changed for password and username).
6. It opens firefox
7. It checks in the author and narrator if it is present, by putting it in, if it is present no harm done,
important for now i have only made it for one narrator and one author(working on it).
8.Then goes for main page and fills all the stuff, ofc there is work to be done especially in the Genre section.
9. You have to check all the stuff to be ok to upload.

It is an helper not all automatic
